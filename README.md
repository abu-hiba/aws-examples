# aws-examples

In this repo I plan to add small examples using the AWS sdk v3 for Node.js for various AWS services as a reference for myself.

Each directory will be named after the AWS product that it is demoing, and each will have a README explaining what it is doing and how to set up the example.

These examples will NOT be production ready or neccessarily follow best practices entirely, the focus is to create a practical reference on how to use the AWS sdk.
